# This a convenience script to build samples in environments
# were pkg-config cannot be used. That can happen if pkg-config
# isn't available or though avialable the nspr and nss libraries
# aren't install in the sytem. This sript assumes that we are
# building the samples as part of a checkout of the nspr and nss
# sources and that nss has already being built.
#
# Invoke with sh ./makesample.s which_sample which_target objs_name
#
# the first argument if the sample to build, if empty then build all
# the second argument is the target, either all or clean, defalt is all
# the third arguments is the name of the objects directory
# for example: Linux3.17_x86_64_glibc_PTH_64_DBG.OBJ
